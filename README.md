# Skript PvP Classes
 These are classes that can be implemented on a 1.9+ minecraft server. Current
 dependences are luck perms for permissions and skript to run the scripts. I'm
 planning on implementing at most 8 classes (4 fighter, 4 caster) because anymore
 than that could easily be considered overloaded and make entry for newer players
 difficult.

# The three archetypes
  Casters: Casters have unique buffs and abilities they can cast on themselves
    and in the future on their allies. Casters very wildly and each has their
    own strengths and weaknesses. In general though casters are weak to melee
    confrontations and take additional damage from the assassin class.
  Fighters: Fighters can generally take a lot of damage and can deal a lot of
    damage. Their strengths and weaknesses are fairly straight forward and their
    abilities although unique and interested are not quite as varied as the
    caster's. A caster caught between two fighters is likely to seem themselves
    destroyed. TODO: Fighters also have basic first aid knowledge allowing them
    to patch themselves up mid fight using paper.

# Assassin
  Strike your foes with a powerful poison and watch them fall to your shield
  piercing attacks. Use your evasion reduces the damage you take from enemies
  and dodge their attacks with your stealth. Assassins need to be flexible and
  thus your armor of choice is full leather. Ghast tears make the most effective
  poison and camouflage. Fighter classification.

# Bard
  Buff yourself with your hyms. Using the note block you can play a number of
  songs which improve your strength, hasten your step, and increase your
  regeneration. Bards are flexible allowing them to wear any armor. Be aware
  however, your years of studying magical hyms shows on the strength of your
  bones and muscles. Caster classification.

# Berserker
  What better weapon can there be than the axe? Using the axe the berserker
  deals ridiculous amounts of damage and can one shot unarmored foes. Using
  rotten flesh the berserker can call forth a burst of speed or a rage to inflict
  mortal wounds on even the strongest of foes. Berserkers need some room to
  breath and so use leather leggings and chestplates, there are no requirements
  for their other armor pieces. Fighter classification.

# Paladin
  Paladins focus on healing. What is the point of having good armor if you
  cannot effectively heal? Paladins have a higher base health stat then other
  classes and have a lot of healing baked into their kit. From purifying
  themselves from debuffs, instantly healing themselves, and granting damage
  immunity for 5 seconds. To more modest healing over time. The paladin's strong
  magic requires a good conduit which is provided by a golden shovel and full
  golden armor. Caster classification.

# Pyromancer
  Burn your enemies, resurrect from the flames of the phoenix and watch your foes
  crumble before your raw unchanneled power. The pyromancer casts fireball
  barrages and single fire ball attacks from afar using the power of the blaze as
  a conduit. If a conflict were to turn into a melee pyromancers can call on the
  power of the phoenix to heal them and resurrect once from death. The
  pyromancer has no armor requirements. Caster classification.
